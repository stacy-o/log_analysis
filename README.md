# Udacity Full Stack Developer project: Log Analysis

## Short project summary
The database contains newspaper articles,
as well as the web server log for the site.
The log has a database row for each time a reader loaded a web page.
Your code will answer questions about the site's user activity.

## Project details

There are 3 DB tables: articles, authors and log.
Table articles has a foreign key referencing authors.
Table log doesn't have explicit relation to other tables.
The task is to create a reporting tool that prints out reports (in plain text)
based on the data in the database.
This reporting tool is a Python program
using the psycopg2 module to connect to the database.

### The project's output
The questions that need to be answered by the project are:
1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
   (Display the answer as article's title followed by -- and number of views)
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
   (The answer is a list of
    authors followed by total sum of visits to their articles)
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
   (The answer is a date followed by the percentage of errors:
    July 29, 2016 â€” 2.5% errors)

### The DB tables info
The database is provided.
